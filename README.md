# Python_Chat_Bot
 Python Chatbot Project Description  This Python chatbot uses the difflib library to interact with users through a friendly conversational interface. The chatbot matches user inputs to predefined questions stored in a knowledge base, providing relevant answers.  Key Features: Natural Language Understanding: Uses get_close_matches to find similar user queries. Knowledge Base: A dictionary contains key-value pairs of questions and corresponding answers. Interactive Loop: Engages users in conversation until they type "bye." Error Handling: Prompts users to rephrase their questions if no close match is found. Example Interaction: User: "hello" Bot: "Hey there! How can I brighten your day today?" This project highlights fundamental concepts in natural language processing and user interaction, showcasing programming skills and the creation of intelligent conversational agents.
